 *      \section overviewSection Overview
 *      Xwonder is a graphical user interface for WONDER (Wave field synthesis of new dimensions of 
 *      electronic music in realtime), which is a softwarebased applicationbundle for wave field 
 *      synthesis consisting of several modules. The aim of xwonder is to provide an interface, 
 *      which facilitates the use of WONDER's functions and establishes a stringent workflow. It 
 *      should allow experienced users as well as those new to WONDER to accomplish their tasks with 
 *      a minimum training period. To facilitate control over the WONDER system Xwonder should 
 *      correctly represent the current sonic state of the system at all times and allow free and
 *      intuitive manipulation of this state.

 *
 *      \section dependencies Dependencies
 *      The recommended way to build Xwonder is by using the software construction tool SCons.<br>
 *      A file called SConstruct (the default filename Scons is looking for when no further buildfile is
 *      specified) should be provided along with wonder's sourcecode, so you will only have to 
 *      call "scons" with the argument "xwonder=1" in Wonder's directory. For further instructions
 *      on wonder's build system please have a look at the Wonder documentation.
 *      
 *      In order to build Xwonder from sourcecode with SCons you will need the following:
 *      - Trolltech Qt 4.x (preferably 4.3.2 or higher)
 *      - Qt4 tool for scons (provided with Wonder's sourcecode)
 *      - liblo (lightweight OSC implementation)
 *      - Wonder library
 *      - pkg-config
 *      - and of course a c++ compiler

 *
 *      \section manualIntro Introduction
 *      Xwonder works like a remote control for the WONDER system. Since WONDER is a distributed application,
 *      it is possible that certain components may run on different computers. Xwonder's only interface to
 *      the whole WONDER system is the cwonder programm. If this component is not running, then no communication
 *      will be possible. If at startup Xwonder cannot establish a connection to cwonder it will notify you.
 *      If at runtime the connection to cwonder is lost, xwonder will shut down.
 *
 *      The workspace of Xwonder consists of a channelarea on the left side similiar to common audio sequencing
 *      software (like e.g. ardour) and a graphical representation of the auditory scene in the main area of Xwonder.
 *      In this main area a representation of the current listening room is displayed. Soundsources are displayed
 *      at their current position (pointsources as spheres, planewave sources as an arrow with a baseplate).
 *      Sources can be grouped with the use of groupobjects (displayed as cubes). A source added to a group is
 *      assigned the color of the groupobject representing this group. Each group of sources has a color, which 
 *      can be changed by changing the color of one of the sources belonging to this group.
 *
 *      \section Startup
 *      Just type "xwonder" in your commandline or use doubleclick if you use a graphical filebrowser.
 *      When starting xwonder from the commandline/terminal you can provide the following arguments:
 *      - -i x Where x is the IP-address of the computer that is running cwonder (default is 127.0.0.1)
 *      - -p x Where x is the port on which cwonder listens (default is 58100)
 *      - -o x Where x is the port on which xwonder listens (default is 58000) 
 *      - -d Run in demomode, i.e. without connecting to cwonder. Only usefull for demoing purposes.
 *      - -v Start in verbose mode. Xwonder prints out the OSC messages it receives.
 *      - -h Print help on commandline arguments.
 *      Starting xwonder without arguments uses the default values (i.e. assuming cwonder runs on the same computer
 *      as Xwonder)
 *
 *      \section Mouseoperation
 *      Most of Xwonder's functionality can easily be accessed by mouse or similar pointing devices.<br>
 *      Here is an overview of the possible mouseoperations in the central windowelement of Xwonder in
 *      which the soundsources, groupobjects as well as the surrounding room are displayed.<br>
 *      (L = left mousebutton, R = right mousebutton)<br>
 *
 *      - When clicking on the background (only if view is not "locked", see "View" menu): 
 *              - L + Up/down           = zoom in/out
 *              - L + CTRL + movement   = movement of the whole image
 *              - L + ALT + Up/Down     = x-axis rotation 
 *              - L + ALT + Right/Left  = y-axis rotation 
 *              - L + SHIFT + Up/Down   = z-axis rotation 
 *              - MouseWheel            = zoom in/out
 *
 *      - When clicking on a source (and thereby selecting it):
 *              - L + movement          = move source 
 *              - L + CTRL + movement   = movement only on x-axis
 *              - L + SHIFT + movement  = movement only on y-axis
 *              - L (hold) + R + Right  = rotate planewave-source clockwise
 *              - L (hold) + R + Left   = rotate planewave-source counterclockwise
 *      
 *      - When clicking on a groupobject (and thereby selecting it):
 *              - L + movement              = move whole group
 *              - L + ALT + Up/Down         = rotate clock-/counterclockwise
 *              - L + ALT + SHIFT +Up/Down  = expande/shrink 
 *              - L (hold) + R + movement   = move only groupobject (not the sources of this group)
 *
 *      - Grouping of sources (first select a groupobject):
 *              - L + CTRL = add/remove selected source to/from group
 *              
 *
 *      Important: To rotate a planewave-source you have to first select it with the left mousebutton and while
 *                 holding the left mousebutton additionally press the right mousebutton and while holding both
 *                 buttons down drag the mouse to the left or right. Pushing both buttons at once does not work.
 *
 *      Stickyclick: This is a feature which facilitates movement of sources with the mouse by locking your 
 *                   mouse onto the selected source (or group). So with stickyclick activated you just leftclick
 *                   on a source, release the button and move the source. To unlock just click again. This
 *                   works also when clicking on the background for movement of the room (only when the view
 *                   is not locked).
 *      
 *      \section Keyboardoperation 
 *      Xwonder provides comprehensive keyboard shortcuts. For actions accessible by menu the shortcuts can be
 *      found in the menus. Here is a list of commands which affect the presentation of the sources in Xwonder 
 *      as well as commands for soundsource movements.
 *
 *      - General:
 *              - Spacebar = start/stop scoreplayer
 * 
 *      - Whole display (only when view is not "locked"):
 *              - x = positive x-axis rotation 
 *              - y = positive y-axis rotation 
 *              - z = positive z-axis rotation
 *              - X = negative x-axis rotation
 *              - Y = negative y-axis rotation
 *              - Z = negative z-axis rotation
 *              - g = zoom in
 *              - h = zoom out
 *                
 *              independent of viewlock: 
 *              - b = smaller sources 
 *              - B = bigger sources
 *
 *      - Selected source:
 *              - Up    = move current source "up"    (positive y-direction)
 *              - Down  = move current source "down"  (negative y-direction)
 *              - Right = move current source "right" (positive x-direction)
 *              - Left  = move current source "left"  (negative x-direction)
 *              - r     = turn record on/off
 *              
 *      - Selected group:
 *              - Up    = move whole group "up"    (positive y-direction)
 *              - Down  = move whole group "down"  (negative y-direction)
 *              - Right = move whole group "right" (positive x-direction)
 *              - Left  = move whole group "left"  (negative x-direction)
 *              - r     = turn record for whole group on/off
 *
 *              - Up    + ALT = move only groupcenter "up"    (positive y-direction)
 *              - Down  + ALT = move only groupcenter "down"  (negative y-direction)
 *              - Right + ALT = move only groupcenter "right" (positive x-direction)
 *              - Left  + ALT = move only groupcenter "left"  (negative x-direction)
