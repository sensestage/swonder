/*! 
 *      \brief
 *      Provides buttons for selecting (setting, etc.) snapshots
 *
 *      \details
 *      Dynamic collection of buttons for taking, recalling, deleting, renaming and copying snapshots.
 *      Buttons are arranged in two rows. Transition time between snapshots is set by a spinbox. Transitions are
 *      not visualized in xwonder, because the other WONDER-modules do not communicate about source positions 
 *      constantly.
