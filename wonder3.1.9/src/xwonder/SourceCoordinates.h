/*! 
 *      \brief
 *      Internal coordinate system (in accordance with OpenGL)
 *
 *      \details
 *      Coordinates and orientation of a single source. 
 *      WONDER uses a somewhat awkward coordinate system so a mapping to OpenGL and overall generally
 *      usefull coordinates is needed.
 *      Conventions internal to Xwonder: 
 *      - origin is in the middle of the room
 *      - x-axis points to the right
 *      - y-axis points upwards
 *      - degrees increase counterclockwise
 *
