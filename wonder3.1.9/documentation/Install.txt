========== WONDER BUILDING AND INSTALLATION ==========

This manual should guide you when installing WONDER on your system and should be used as a reference for
information regarding which files belong to the WONDER system. For information on using WONDER please
refer to the file "Manual.txt", which should be found in the same directory this file is located in.



===== REQUIREMENTS =====

The libraries and tools you will need to build all modules of WONDER:
scons
pkg-config
libxml++2.6
libjack
libfftw3
libsndfile
libasound (alsa)
liblo
Qt4.4x
c++ compiler (like gcc/g++)

If you are building WONDER from source, note that some Linux distributions make a difference between library package for development (which include headers) and normal library packages. So you need to install the development packages (e.g. in Debian indicated with -dev at the end).


===== QUICKSTART =====

1) Go to WONDERs root directory. 
   (Where the file SConstruct is located, usually one step above the directory where this file here is found.)
2) As a normal user type: scons all=1
   This will compile the sourcecode. 
3) As a normal user type: sudo scons install all=1
   (Or do it as root, if you cannot use sudo)
   This will install the compiled code.
4) Setup all the configuration files according to your system. Please refer to "Manual.txt" for this. 
5) Start the modules you want to use.



===== OVERVIEW =====

WONDER uses SCons as its build tool. It enables you to compile and install WONDER quite easily. 
WONDER is modular software so you can build each module on its own or the whole package.

First navigate to WONDERs root directory, this is where the file SConstruct can be found.
All the commands in this manual should be executed from this directory.

In the WONDER root directory you will find the following subdirectories:

"documentation" 
Here you can find this installation instruction, a manual, an overview sheet for the OSC messages
and commandline arguments for each module, the GPL and the WONDER fileheader which should also appear at the 
beginning of every sourcecode file.

"configs"
Here you can find sample configuration files for all WONDER modules. Copies of these will also be installed
when installing WONDER and used by default if you don't provide different files via commandline arguments
when running the modules. 

"dtd"
This is where all the dtd (Document Type Definition) files are. Most modules use XML files for
configuration and these XML files will be validated by the dtd files found here.

"src"
This is where all the source code is found. Each module has its own subdirectory. Library headers are
located in "include". 

"tools"
Additional useful things. The qt4tool is needed so that SCons can build programms using Qt4. In
scripts you can find some shell scripts which facilitate running WONDER as a distributed
application across multiple machines. 


After the first build you will find additional subdirectories:
(It is mandatory that you run your first build as a normal user, i.e. the user who owns the
WONDER directory, because these directories will be created with ownership for the user
doing the build.)

"bin"
This is where all the final executable files and libraries will be written to when building.

"obj"
This is where all the intermediate build files (object files) will be written to. Usually
nothing you would have to look into.


If you haven't changed the default configuration in respect to where user data should be stored
you will find two additional subdirectories when saving a project (and score):

"projects"
Cwonder stores its projects here by default.

"scores"
The Scoreplayer stores scores here by default.



===== BUILDING =====

You can build each WONDER module individually or multiple at once. 
A build target is specified by name and by a flag (1 or 0) to build it (or not).

Here are some examples:
scons cwonder=1
scons jfwonder=1 lib=1 cwonder=1
scons all=1
scons wfs=1

Available modules are:
lib         = the wonder library, needed by almost every other module
jackpp      = a libray connecting WONDER to the JACK API
cwonder     = the central communication program for all wfs related modules
twonder     = wfs rendering
fwonder     = convolution engine
xwonder     = graphical user interface for wfs
scoreplayer = "source data tape recorder" for wfs
jfwonder    = auxiliary timer application for cwonder
qfwonder    = graphical representation tool for fwonder
tracker     = application generating osc messages based on a connected tracking device 

There are some special convenience targets provided:
all = this builds all of the above targets
wfs = wavefield synthesis related targets, namely: lib, jackpp, twonder, cwonder, xwonder, scoreplayer, jfwonder
bas = binaural  synthesis related targets, namely: lib, jackpp, fwonder, qfwonder, tracker

All targets are turned off by default, so nothing really happens by running scons unless you specify one or 
more targets.


Options for debugging or optimizing the code are set by the build option:

build=debug
This passes the argument "-c" to the compiler and generates debuggable code.

build=release
This passes the following arguments to the compiler
-O3
-march=native
-msse
-msse2
-msse3
-mfpmath=sse
and defines the NDEBUG symbol. This generates optimized code.
Feel free to adjust those settings according to your system by editing the SConstruct file.

Here is an example:
scons bas=1 build=debug

The optimized release configuration is used by default.


A file containing information about your last build can be found in WONDERs root directory and is
called wonder.built.info. This file also gets copied into the same directory as the configuration files 
when installing, so you can reconstruct what happend on the last installation. But be aware that 
currently only data about the last installation is kept. So if you only installed some modules in 
addition to already existing other modules the data about the previous modules will not be kept
in wonder.built.info.


NOTE: In the directory "src/ladspa" you will find a MakeFile for building LADSPA plugins that can send OSC data to cwonder to control sources. You need to have perl installed to build.


===== HELP =====

To get help on SCons type:
scons -H	( for standard SCons arguments )
scons -h	( for WONDER related SCons build options, e.g. available targets and their default settings )



===== CLEAN UP =====

To remove the files built so far you can use scons' option "-c". This will clear all intermediate build files
as well as the executables and libraries. This does not remove installed files. This only affects the WONDER root 
directory and its subdirectories. You must provide targets just as when building. 

Here are some examples:
scons -c all=1
scons -c twonder=1 fwonder=1
scons -c wfs=1



===== INSTALL =====

In order to install modules on your system you need to first build the module. It is mandatory that you provide the
correct "installto" path even when not yet installing. This will set some internal search paths which are vital to
the correct workings of WONDER. If something does not work out when running WONDER, then delete the file "src/include/config.h"
and redo the whole build process with the correct "installto" path set. For information on the build process please refer to
the BUILD section for this. After the desired modules have been built you can install them by typing "scons install" along 
with the target options you specified when building. By default installation will be done to "/usr/local". Your can 
change this by providing scons with the option "installto" which should be the path you want to install to. For a detailed 
overview of what will be installed where please refer to the UNINSTALL section below. Usually you need root privileges to 
access directories suited for installation. 

Here are some examples:
(sudo) scons install all=1
(sudo) scons install cwonder=1
(sudo) scons install wfs=1 installto=/opt/wonder



===== UNINSTALL =====

There is no mechanism for a clean uninstall yet, sorry. In order to remove all installed parts of WONDER you have to remember (or find out) to
